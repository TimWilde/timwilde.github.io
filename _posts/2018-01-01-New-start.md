It's been a long time since I ran my own blog.

I've been learning a lot of interesting things recently and I felt like talking about them a bit, so I decided that it's time to restart blogging. That means this blog will mostly be about software development with some devops-y stuff here and there. I'm sure some other things will creep in too.
